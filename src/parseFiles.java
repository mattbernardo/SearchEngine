//Create code that handles parsing a single text file into words. Test your code.
// Use the UTF-8 character encoding for all file processing, including reading and writing.
// Replace all characters except letters and digits with an empty string. This includes 
// the _ underscore character as well. For example, the word age_long should be seen as 
// agelong since the _ underscore will be replaced with an empty string.
// Separate text into words by any whitespace character, including spaces, tabs, and newline characters.
// Words must be case-insensitive. For example, the words APPLE, Apple, apple, and aPpLe should all be seen as the same word.
